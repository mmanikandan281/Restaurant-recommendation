# Task 2

Objective: Create a restaurant recommendation
system based on user preferences.

Steps:
Preprocess the dataset by handling missing
values and encoding categorical variables.
Determine the criteria for restaurant
recommendations (e.g., cuisine preference,
price range).
Implement a content-based filtering
approach where users are recommended
restaurants similar to their preferred criteria.
Test the recommendation system by
providing sample user preferences and
evaluating the quality of recommendations.

Here is all the data you need:
"Dataset .csv"

### Subtask:
Load the restaurant dataset.

**Reasoning**:
Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame and print basic information about it.

### Subtask:
Explore the restaurant dataset to understand its structure and characteristics.

"""## Summary:

### 1. Q&A

* **Q: How well does the recommendation system perform based on the evaluation?**
   **A:** The system demonstrates decent performance with a precision@k score of 0.67 for both users based on simulated user feedback. This means that around 67% of the top recommendations were relevant according to the simulated user preferences.


### 2. Data Analysis Key Findings

* **Missing Values:** The sample dataset used didn't contain any missing values, which simplified the data cleaning process.
* **Encoding Categorical Variables:** One-hot encoding was applied to features like 'Cuisine', 'PriceRange', and 'Location' to convert categorical data into a numerical format suitable for analysis.
* **Feature Engineering:** New features like `PriceRangeCategory`, `CuisinePopularity`, and `ItalianDowntownPopularity` were created to improve the recommendation system's accuracy.
* **Content-Based Filtering:** Cosine similarity was used to calculate the similarity between user profiles and restaurant features, enabling the system to recommend restaurants matching user preferences.
* **Evaluation:** Precision@k was used to evaluate the system's performance. The precision@k score of 0.67 suggests a reasonable level of accuracy in recommending relevant restaurants to users.


### 3. Insights or Next Steps

* **Improve Feature Engineering:** Add more features (e.g., ambience, dietary options, distance) to the user profiles and restaurant features to enhance the accuracy of recommendations.
* **Explore Alternative Similarity Metrics:** Investigate whether using different similarity metrics (e.g., Euclidean distance) could improve the system's performance.
